              Specifying New Congestion Control Algorithms
                   draft-ietf-ccwg-rfc5033bis-latest

Abstract

   The IETF's standard congestion control schemes have been widely shown
   to be inadequate for various environments (e.g., high-speed networks,
   wireless technologies such as 3GPP and WiFi, long distance satellite
   links) and also in conflict with the needed, more isochronous,
   behaviors of VoIP, gaming, and videoconferencing traffic.  Recent
   research has yielded many alternate congestion control schemes that
   significantly differ from the IETF's congestion control principles.
   Using these new congestion control schemes in the global Internet has
   possible ramifications to both the traffic using the new congestion
   control and to traffic using the currently standardized congestion
   control.  Therefore, the IETF must proceed with caution when dealing
   with alternate congestion control proposals.  The goal of this
   document is to provide guidance for considering alternate congestion
   control algorithms within the IETF.

1.  Introduction

   This document provides guidelines for the IETF to use when evaluating
   suggested congestion control algorithms that significantly differ
   from the general congestion control principles outlined in [RFC2914].
   The guidance is intended to be useful to authors proposing alternate
   congestion control and for the IETF community when evaluating whether
   a proposal is appropriate for publication in the RFC series and for
   deployment in the Internet.

   This document updates the similarly titled [RFC5033] that was
   published in 2007 as a Best Current Practice to evaluate new
   congestion control algorithms as Experimental or Proposed Standard
   RFCs.

   In 2007, TCP was the dominant consumer of this work, and proposals
   were typically discussed in research groups, for example the Internet
   Congestion Control Research Group (ICCRG).

   Since RFC 5033 was published, many conditions have changed.  The set
   of protocols using these algorithms has spread beyond TCP and SCTP to
   include DCCP, QUIC, and beyond.  Some congestion control algorithm
   proponents now have the opportunity to test and deploy at scale
   without IETF review.  There is more interest in specialized use cases
   such as data centers and real-time protocols.  Finally, the community
   has gained much more experience with indications of congestion beyond
   packet loss.

   Multiple congestion control algorithms have been developed outside of
   the IETF, including at least two that saw large scale deployment:
   Cubic [HRX08] and BBR [BBR-draft].

   Cubic was documented in a research publication in 2007 [HRX08], and
   then adopted as the default congestion control algorithm for the TCP
   implementation in Linux.  It was already used in a significant
   fraction of TCP connections over the Internet before being documented
   in an informational Internet Draft in 2015, being published as an
   informational RFC in 2017 [RFC8312] and then as a proposed standard
   in 2023 [RFC9438].

   BBR is developed as an internal research project by Google, with the
   first implementation contributed to Linux kernel 4.19 in 2016.  It
   was described in an IRTF draft in 2018, and that draft is regularly
   updated to document the evolving versions of the algorithm
   [BBR-draft].  BBR is widely used for Google services using either TCP
   or QUIC [RFC9000], and is also largely deployed outside of Google.

   We cannot say now whether the original authors of [RFC5033] expected
   that developers would be somehow waiting for IETF review before
   widely deploying a congestion control algorithm over the Internet,
   but the examples of Cubic and BBR teaches us that deployment of new
   algorithms is not in fact gated by publication of the algorithm as an
   RFC.  Nevertheless, guidelines are important, if only to remind
   potential inventors and developers of the multiple facets of the
   congestion control problem.

   The guidelines in this document are intended to be consistent with
   the congestion control principles from [RFC2914] of preventing
   congestion collapse, considering fairness, and optimizing the flow's
   own performance in terms of throughput, delay, and loss.  [RFC2914]
   also discusses the goal of avoiding a congestion control "arms race"
   among competing transport protocols.

   This document does not give hard-and-fast requirements for an
   appropriate congestion control scheme.  Rather, the document provides
   a set of criteria that should be considered and weighed by the
   developers of congestion control algorithms and by the IETF in the
   context of each proposal.  The high-order criteria for any new
   proposal is that a serious scientific study of the pros and cons of
   the proposal needs to have been done before a proposal is considered
   for publication by the IETF or before it is deployed at large scale.

   After initial studies, we encourage authors to write a specification
   of their proposals for publication in the RFC series to allow others
   to concretely understand and investigate the wealth of proposals in
   this space.

2.  Document Status

   Following the lead of HighSpeed TCP [RFC3649], alternate congestion
   control algorithms are expected to be published as "Experimental"
   RFCs until such time that the community better understands the
   solution space.  Traditionally, the meaning of "Experimental" status
   has varied in its use and interpretation.  As part of this document
   we define two classes of congestion control proposals that can be
   published with the "Experimental" status.  The first class includes
   algorithms that are judged to be safe to deploy for best-effort
   traffic in the global Internet and further investigated in that
   environment.  The second class includes algorithms that, while
   promising, are not deemed safe enough for widespread deployment as
   best-effort traffic on the Internet, but are being specified to
   facilitate investigations in simulation, testbeds, or controlled
   environments.  The second class can also include algorithms where the
   IETF does not yet have sufficient understanding to decide if the
   algorithm is or is not safe for deployment on the Internet.

   Each alternate congestion control algorithm published is required to
   include a statement in the abstract indicating whether or not the
   proposal is considered safe for use on the Internet.  Each alternate
   congestion control algorithm published is also required to include a
   statement in the abstract describing environments where the protocol
   is not recommended for deployment.  There may be environments where
   the protocol is deemed _safe_ for use, but still is not _recommended_
   for use because it does not perform well for the user.

   As examples of such statements, [RFC3649] specifying HighSpeed TCP
   includes a statement in the abstract stating that the proposal is
   Experimental, but may be deployed in the current Internet.  In
   contrast, the Quick-Start document [RFC4782] includes a paragraph in
   the abstract stating the mechanism is only being proposed for
   controlled environments.  The abstract specifies environments where
   the Quick-Start request could give false positives (and therefore
   would be unsafe for incremental deployment where some routers
   forward, but do not process the option).  The abstract also specifies
   environments where packets containing the Quick-Start request could
   be dropped in the network; in such an environment, Quick-Start would
   not be unsafe to deploy, but deployment would not be recommended
   because it could lead to unnecessary delays for the connections
   attempting to use Quick-Start.  The Quick-Start method is discussed
   as an example in [RFC9049].

   For authors of alternate congestion control schemes who are not ready
   to bring their congestion control mechanisms to the IETF for
   standardization (either as Experimental or as Proposed Standard), one
   possibility would be to submit an internet-draft that documents the
   alternate congestion control mechanism for the benefit of the IETF
   and IRTF communities.  This is particularly encouraged in order to
   ensure algorithm specifications are widely disseminated to facilitate
   further research.  Such an internet-draft could also be considered as
   an Informational RFC, as a first step in the process towards
   standardization.  Such a document would be expected to carry an
   explicit warning against using the scheme in the global Internet.

   Note: we are not changing the RFC publication process for non-IETF
   produced documents (e.g., those from the IRTF or Independent
   Submissions via the RFC-Editor).  However, we would hope the
   guidelines in this document inform the IESG as they consider whether
   to add a note to such documents.

3.  Guidelines

   As noted above, authors are expected to do a well-rounded evaluation
   of the pros and cons of proposals brought to the IETF.  The following
   are guidelines to help authors and the IETF community.  Concerns that
   fall outside the scope of these guidelines are certainly possible;
   these guidelines should not be considered as an all-encompassing
   check-list.

   (0)  Differences with Congestion Control Principles [RFC2914]

      Proposed congestion control mechanisms should include a clear
      explanation of the deviations from [RFC2914].

   (1)  Impact on existing deployments of TCP [RFC9293], SCTP [RFC9260],
      DCCP [RFC4340], and QUIC [RFC9000].

      Proposed congestion control mechanisms should be evaluated when
      competing with standard IETF congestion control [RFC5681],
      [RFC9260], [RFC4340], [RFC9002], [RFC9438].  Alternate congestion
      controllers that have a significantly negative impact on traffic
      using standard congestion control may be suspect and this aspect
      should be part of the community's decision making with regards to
      the suitability of the alternate congestion control mechanism.
      The community should also consider other non-standard congestion
      controls known to be widely deployed,

      We note that this bullet is not a requirement for strict Reno- or
      Cubic- friendliness as a prerequisite for an alternate congestion
      control mechanism to advance to Experimental.  As an example,
      HighSpeed TCP is a congestion control mechanism that is
      Experimental, but that is not TCP-friendly in all environments.
      When a new algorithm is deployed, the existing major deployments
      need to be considered to avoid severe performance degradation.  We
      also note that this guideline does not constrain the interaction
      with non-best-effort traffic.

      As an example from an Experimental RFC, fairness with standard TCP
      is discussed in Sections 4 and 6 of [RFC3649] (HighSpeed TCP) and
      using spare capacity is discussed in Sections 6, 11.1, and 12 of
      [RFC3649].

   (2)  Wireless links

      While the early Internet was dominated by wired links, the
      properties of wireless links have become extremely important to
      Internet performance.  In particular, congestion controllers
      should be evaluated in situations where some packet losses are due
      to radio effects, rather than router queue drops; the link
      capacity varies over time due to changing link conditions; and
      media access delays and link-layer retransmission lead to
      increased jitter in round-trip times.  See [RFC3819] and
      Section 16 of [Tools] for further discussion of wireless
      properties.

   (3)  Difficult Environments.

      The proposed algorithms should be assessed in difficult
      environments.  We note that there is still much to be desired in
      terms of the performance of TCP in some of these difficult
      environments.  For congestion control mechanisms with explicit
      feedback from routers, difficult environments can include paths
      with non-IP queues at layer-two, IP tunnels, and the like.  A
      minimum goal for experimental mechanisms proposed for widespread
      deployment in the Internet should be that they do not perform
      significantly worse than TCP in these environments.

      While it is impossible to enumerate all the possible "difficult
      environments", we note that the IETF has previously grappled with
      paths with long delays [RFC2488], high delay bandwidth products
      [RFC3649], high packet corruption rates [RFC3155], packet
      reordering [RFC4653], and significantly slow links [RFC3150].
      Aspects of alternate congestion control that impact networks with
      these characteristics should be detailed.

      As an example from an Experimental RFC, performance in difficult
      environments is discussed in Sections 6, 9.2, and 10.2 of
      [RFC4782] (Quick-Start).

   (4)  Investigating a Range of Environments.

      Similar to the last criteria, proposed alternate congestion
      controllers should be assessed in a range of environments.  For
      instance, proposals should be investigated across a range of
      capacities, round-trip times, levels of traffic on the reverse
      path, and levels of statistical multiplexing at the congested
      link.  Similarly, proposals should be investigated for robust
      performance with different queueing mechanisms in the routers,
      especially Random Early Detection (RED) [FJ03] and Drop-Tail.
      This evaluation is often not included in the internet-draft
      itself, but in related papers cited in the draft.

      A particularly important aspect of evaluating a proposal for
      standardization is in understanding where the algorithm breaks
      down.  Therefore, particular attention should be paid to
      characterizing the areas where the proposed mechanism does not
      perform well.

      As an example from an Experimental RFC, performance in a range of
      environments is discussed in Section 12 of [RFC3649] (HighSpeed
      TCP) and Section 9.7 of [RFC4782] (Quick-Start).

   (5)  Protection Against Congestion Collapse

      The alternate congestion control mechanism should either stop
      sending when the packet drop rate exceeds some threshold
      [RFC3714], or should include some notion of "full backoff".  For
      "full backoff", at some point the algorithm would reduce the
      sending rate to one packet per round-trip time and then
      exponentially backoff the time between single packet transmissions
      if congestion persists.  Exactly when either "full backoff" or a
      pause in sending comes into play will be algorithm-specific.
      However, as discussed in [RFC2914], this requirement is crucial to
      protect the network in times of extreme congestion.

      If "full backoff" is used, this bullet does not require that the
      full backoff mechanism must be identical to that of TCP [RFC2988].
      As an example, this bullet does not preclude full backoff
      mechanisms that would give flows with different round- trip times
      comparable caapcity during backoff.

   (6)  Protection Against Bufferbloat

      The alternate congestion control mechanism should reduce its
      sending rate if the round trip time (RTT) significantly increases.
      Exactly how the algorithm reduces its sending rate is algorithm
      specific.

      Bufferbloat [Bufferbloat] refers to the building of long queues in
      the network.  Many network routers are configured with very large
      buffers.  If congestion starts happening, classic TCP congestion
      control algorithms [RFC5681] will continue sending at a high rate
      until the buffer fills up completely and packet losses occur.
      Every connection going through that bottleneck will experience
      high latency.  This is particularly bad for highly interactive
      applications like games, but it also affects routine web browsing
      and video playing.

      This problem became apparent in the last decade and was not
      discussed in the Congestion Control Principles published in
      September 2002 [RFC2914].  The classic congestion control
      algorithm [RFC5681] and the widely deployed Cubic algorithm
      [RFC9438] do not address it, but newly designed congestion control
      algorithms have the opportunity to improve the state of the art.

   (7)  Fairness within the Alternate Congestion Control Algorithm.

      In environments with multiple competing flows all using the same
      alternate congestion control algorithm, the proposal should
      explore how the capacity is shared among the competing flows.

   (8)  Test for the effect of path changes

   An IETF transport is not tied to a specific Internet path.  The set
   of routers forming a path can and do change with time, this will also
   cause the properties of the path to change with respect to time.  New
   CCs MUST evaluate the impact of changes in the path, and be robust to
   changes in path characteristics on the interval of common Internet
   re-routing intervals.

   (9)  Utilising More than one Path.

      Multipath transport protocols permit more than one path to be
      differentiated and used by a single connection at the sender.  A
      multipath sender can schedule which packets travel on which of its
      active paths.  This enables a tradeoff in timeliness and
      reliability.

   One use is to provide fail-over from one path to

   another when the original path is no longer viable or to switch
   the traffic from

   one path to another when this is expected to improve performance

   (latency, throughput, reliability, cost).

   Designs need to independently track the congestion state of each
   path,

   and need to demonstrate independent congestion control for each
   path being used.

   New multipath CCs that implement path fail-over MUST evaluate the
   harm resulting

   from a change in the path, and show that this does not result in
   flow starvation.

   Synchronisation of failover (e.g., where multiple flows change
   their path on similar

   timeframes) can also contribute to harm and/or reduce fairness,

   these effects also ought to be evaluated.  A concurrent multipath
      transport protocol simultaneously schedules flows to aggregate the
      capacity across multiple paths.  The Internet provides no
      guarantee that different paths (e.g., using different endpoint
      addresses) are disjoint.  This has additional implications: New
      CCs MUST evaluate the potential harm to other flows when the
      multiple paths share a common congested bottleneck (or share
      resources that are coupled between different paths, such as an
      overall capacity limit), and SHOULD consider the fairness with
      other flows.  Synchronisation of CC mechanisms (e.g., where
      multiple flows change their behaviour on similar timeframes) can
      also contribute to harm and/or reduce fairness, these effects also
      ought to be evaluated.  At the time of writing, there are no IETF
      standards for concurrent multipath congestion control in the
      general Internet.

   (10)  Performance with Misbehaving Nodes and Outside Attackers.

      The proposal should explore how the alternate congestion control
      mechanism performs with misbehaving senders, receivers, or
      routers.  In addition, the proposal should explore how the
      alternate congestion control mechanism performs with outside
      attackers.  This can be particularly important for congestion
      control mechanisms that involve explicit feedback from routers
      along the path.

      As an example from an Experimental RFC, performance with
      misbehaving nodes and outside attackers is discussed in Sections
      9.4, 9.5, and 9.6 of [RFC4782] (Quick-Start).  This includes
      discussion of misbehaving senders and receivers; collusion between
      misbehaving routers; misbehaving middleboxes; and the potential
      use of Quick-Start to attack routers or to tie up available Quick-
      Start bandwidth.

   (11)  Responses to Sudden or Transient Events.

      The proposal should consider how the alternate congestion control
      mechanism would perform in the presence of transient events such
      as sudden congestion, a routing change, or a mobility event.
      Routing changes, link disconnections, intermittent link
      connectivity, and mobility are discussed in more detail in
      Section 17 of [Tools].

      As an example from an Experimental RFC, response to transient
      events is discussed in Section 9.2 of [RFC4782] (Quick-Start).

   (12)  Incremental Deployment.

      The proposal should discuss whether the alternate congestion
      control mechanism allows for incremental deployment in the
      targeted environment.  For a mechanism targeted for deployment in
      the current Internet, it would be helpful for the proposal to
      discuss what is known (if anything) about the correct operation of
      the mechanism with some of the equipment installed in the current
      Internet, e.g., routers, transparent proxies, WAN optimizers,
      intrusion detection systems, home routers, and the like.

      As a similar concern, if the alternate congestion control
      mechanism is intended only for specific environments (and not the
      global Internet), the proposal should consider how this intention
      is to be carried out.  The community will have to address the
      question of whether the scope can be enforced by simply stating
      the restrictions or whether additional protocol mechanisms are
      required to enforce the scoping.  The answer will necessarily
      depend on the change being proposed.

      As an example from an Experimental RFC, deployment issues are
      discussed in Sections 10.3 and 10.4 of [RFC4782] (Quick-Start).

4.  Minimum Requirements

   This section suggests minimum requirements for a document to be
   approved as Experimental with approval for widespread deployment in
   the global Internet.

   The minimum requirements for approval for widespread deployment in
   the global Internet include the following guidelines on: (1)
   assessing the impact on standard congestion control, (2) performance
   in wireless environments, (4) investigation of the proposed mechanism
   in a range of environments, (5) protection against congestion
   collapse, and (12) discussing whether the mechanism allows for
   incremental deployment.

   For other guidelines, the author must perform the suggested
   evaluations and provide recommended analysis.  Evidence that the
   proposed mechanism has significantly more problems than those of TCP
   should be a cause for concern in approval for widespread deployment
   in the global Internet.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not represent a change to any aspect of the TCP/IP
   protocol suite and therefore does not directly impact Internet
   security.  The implementation of various facets of the Internet's
   current congestion control algorithms do have security implications
   (e.g., as outlined in [RFC5681]).  Alternate congestion control
   schemes should be mindful of such pitfalls, as well, and should
   examine any potential security issues that may arise.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

Acknowledgments

   Sally Floyd and Mark Allman were the authors of this document's
   predecessor, RFC5033, which served the community well for over a
   decade.

   Thanks to Richard Scheffenegger for helping to get this revision
   process started.

   Discussions with Lars Eggert and Aaron Falk seeded the original
   RFC5033.  Bob Briscoe, Gorry Fairhurst, Doug Leith, Jitendra Padhye,
   Colin Perkins, Pekka Savola, members of TSVWG, and participants at
   the TCP Workshop at Microsoft Research all provided feedback and
   contributions to that document.  It also drew from [RFC5166].

   These individuals suggested improvements to this document:
